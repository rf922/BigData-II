# BigData-II
This is Part II of a two-part project originally assigned in Advanced Java Programming, taught by Jessica Masters. While Part I focused on text and CSV analysis using Java Streams, BigData-II dives deeper into data modeling and stream-based aggregation, using a large dataset of personal care products and their chemical compositions.
